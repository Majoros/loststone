{"name":"Loststone","tagline":"","body":"#loststone\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe loststone project is a fully open source trackball. loststone was designed\r\nfrom ground up. It is not based on any existing trackballs or mice. It does however take\r\ninspiration of existing open source projects such as [mbed](http://mbed.org) and\r\n[USBug](http://squonk42.github.com/USBug/)\r\n\r\n##Fetures\r\n=========\r\n\r\nloststone is being designed to perform as well as any trackball/mouse on the\r\nmarket today. In addition it is going to have several features that are not found\r\non any product yet offered.\r\n\r\n   * Fully Open-Source:<br>\r\n     Hardware & Software (CC-BY-SA, GPL3)\r\n   * No drivers:<br>\r\n     Drivers are annoying. Especially when there is no need for them. Lost stone\r\n     is being designed to use the OS level HID drivers.\r\n   * Fully configurable:<br>\r\n     Anything that could be configurable will be configurable, without having\r\n     to change the code and flash the chip. [Default configuration file.](https://github.com/Majoros/loststone/blob/master/config/loststone.cfg)\r\n   * Easily programmable:<br>\r\n     If there is a need to flash the firmware it is as easy as copying a file to\r\n     a flash drive (Thank you NXP).\r\n   * Firmware cursor acceleration:<br>\r\n     Cursor acceleration is implemented within the firmware. It is configurable and optional.\r\n   * Fully programmable buttons:<br>\r\n     You want the left button to be on the right and the right button on the\r\n     left? go for it. No need to change any hardware or software.\r\n   * Profiles:<br>\r\n     There are 5 selectable profiles. Each profile has the ability to configure\r\n     any and all programmable features. This is good for multiple users or a\r\n     single users that like different settings for different situations.\r\n\r\n##Specifications\r\n\r\n####Hardware\r\n\r\n   * **Sensor**([ADNS-9500](http://www.pixart.com.tw/product_data_table.asp?ToPage=1&productclassify_id=1&productclassify2_id=3)):\r\n     * High speed motion: 150ips and 30G\r\n     * Frame rate: Up to 11,750fps\r\n     * Selectable resolution: Up to 5040cpi with 90cpi step size\r\n     * Independent X and Y resolutions\r\n   * **MCU**([LPC11U24](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/cortex_m0_m0/LPC11U24FBD48.html)):\r\n     * Processing Power: Cortex-M0, which is, to say the least complete overkill.\r\n     * Easily programmable: Thanks to the LPC11U24 reprograming is as easy as\r\n       copying a file to a flash drive.\r\n     * GPIO: with 40 GPIO pins there are more than enough pins for buttons and\r\n       LED's and anything else that may come up.\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n\r\n   * Any OS released in the past decade.\r\n     Ok, to be a bit more specific an OS that supports USB HID\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nIf anyone else actually decides to make one of these and you come accross any issues use the ([github issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/Majoros/loststone/issues)).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
